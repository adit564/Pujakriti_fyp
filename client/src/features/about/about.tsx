          <h3> Pujakriti – Keeping Traditions Alive, the Right Way.</h3>
          <h5 className="home_desc_text">
            Nepal is a land of deep spirituality, where every community
            celebrates its own unique rituals. From birth to death, from
            festivals to daily prayers—pujas connect us to our roots, to our
            gods, and to each other. At Pujakriti, we honor this diversity by
            offering carefully curated puja bundles, tailored to different
            castes and ceremonies. Each bundle includes all essential items
            along with a step-by-step guide, so you can perform every ritual
            with confidence and devotion. Whether you're near or far, keeping
            your tradition alive is now just a click away.
